    -> Half plane fulfilling the greater inequality from given line ax+by+c>0
    Line needs to intersect with the ellipse (non-intersecting or tangent lines are invalid)

    Note:
        The following two equations are equivalent ax+by+c=0, -ax-by-c=0. However, due to
        our convention (line specifies half-plane fulfilling greater inequality), they
        define opposite half planes
        1) ax+by+c>0
        2) -ax-by-c>0 => ax+by+c<0

        Another way to interpret this is using normal vectors. A line ax+by+c=0 has two perpendicular
        normal vectors (c/b, c/a) and (-c/b, -c/a). We will use the convention that the line parametrizes
        the half plane in the direction of the first one. So negating the line would have the opposite
        normal vector
